# Monthly family plan


## Basic assumptions 

The basis for this plan is an assumption that kids in our family have their sets of both responsibilities as well as privileges.

Another underlying assumption is: since they are homeschooled, the house is their primary place of living, studying, working and playing, and therefore it is crucial to the success of the whole family that they contribute to the cleanliness, orderliness and overall posivite atmosphere of our home.

The plan is monthly, which means that each month begins with a retrospective and planning meeting where we discuss how we did last month, and responsibility sets are exchanged between kids (if needed). The meeting is also a time to collect rewards for jobs well done (a lottery). We also discuss any kids’ issues and concerns that may have arisen during the month.

### Kitchen duty 
Rotated on daily basis between the oldest three. Each has two kitchen  duties in a week. Sunday is a no-duty day for the kids. 

### Main responsibility 
Rotated monthly. A kid should complete his/her responsibility ~ twice a week, or on Mommy’s request. The youngest one only gets to sort the shoes, he’s no good for anything else yet.

### Bathroom responsibility 
Same rule as with main responsibility. The youngest one should get support from parent.

### Individual work time 
Daily study routine for school kids starting at 9 am and lasting 2-3 hours. Assignements and exercise books are then checked by parent. Kids may of course get support and help from parent while studying, if needed.

### Afternoon  routine 
Lots of extracurricular activities for all the kids. Jagna’s music school is probably the most engaging and time-intensive of all.  

## Privileges

Each kid in the family has privileges that apply on a monthly basis.

### Going out with parent 
Once in a month, kid selects which parent he/she wants to go out with and suggests the place. Could be a walk in the park, a cafe, a swimming pool, a bike ride, etc.   

### Lottery
At start of each month, each kid gets 4 tickets for a lottery held during the retro/planning meeting. If he/she doesn’t perform their duties and/or responsibilities, they may lose a ticket. Lottery prizes range from candies or other treats to special “cards” that give the owner some special privilege (e.g. staying until late one night in a month, going shopping with Dad, etc.).
